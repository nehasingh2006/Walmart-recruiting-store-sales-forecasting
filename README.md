Walmart Weekly Sales Prediction
## Problem
Identifying the impact of holidays and five markdown features on the weekly sales across different stores of walmart with different departments. Weekly sales can be predicted by monitoring a variety of different indicators. Example: Location of store, size of store, Holidays weeks, Promotional weeks, etc are different factors which can affect the sales of the stores, which introduces more complexity to the regression process.
## The goal of this project
The goal of project is to successfully predict. we are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments and we are tasked to predicte the department-wide sales for each store
## Solution
We propose a solution which uses machine learning techniques like Multi linear regression, KNN, Decision Trees and Random Forest to model and predict the sales. A well trained and generalized model will be able to predict the weekly sales across different department. Furthermore, we will also implement Hyperparameter tuning techniques like RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to optimizes the model for the metric that we choose.The models will be tested for their accuracy and robustness using evaluation metrics like MAE, WMAE, MSE, RMSE and R-square.
